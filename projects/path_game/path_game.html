        <h1>Optimal Path Game</h1>
        <div id="description">
            <p>
                Welcome to a small game I've made about finding the optimal path!
            </p>
            <p>
                I thought about this game while reading the first section of the first chapter of the book "The Algorithm Design Manual" by Steven S. Skiena.
                The book is more entertaining than I'll describe it here (it's a fun read I promise), but the general premise is: giving a collection of points,
                what is the most optimal path between then all? The book outlines a couple of algorithms that seem like they work, but always comes up with a
                counterexample for why that particular algoirhtm doesn't work. This got me thinking: Wouldn't it be cool to make it so that people could test
                their algoirhtms? And thus, I decided to make this game!
            </p>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of the game is to find the optimal closed loop between the points. Clicking on one point will turn it green and if you click on another
                point, this will draw a blue line that connects the two together. One point can only be connected to two other points at a given time, and the 
                game ends when all points are connected together. When this happens, a red line will show up that connects all points together showing the optimal 
                path between the points shown. If your path matches the red path, then you win!
            </p>
            <p>
                Once a line is drawn, you cannot undo it directly. For this reason, I have created a "Reset Lines" button on the bottom right which erases all lines 
                but keeps the points the same. Should you want to play a new game with the same number of points, but a different orientation, then the "Reset Points" 
                button will randomly generate a new set of points (and erase the lines as well). To change the number of points to play with, the arrow on the 
                left decreases the points by 1 while the arrow on the right increases the points by 1. There is a maximum of 10 points and a minimum of 3 (I'm not 
                sure why you'd want to play 3 points, but you can).
